# PROJECT DISCONTINUED UNTIL I GET MOTIVATION
I will be working on small parts every now and then, but this project is too ambitious for me to try this hard right now.
# PCZen
**PCZen** is a tool I developed to map PS4 controller inputs to keyboard keys, enabling the creation of macros and providing controller support for games that lack native PS4 controller compatibility. My goal is to deliver the best possible gaming experience for users.

**Please Note:** This project is currently in its alpha stage. You may encounter bugs and incomplete features. I appreciate your understanding and patience during this phase.

I will be launching a Discord server soon, where you can join the community, report bugs, and share your feedback.
